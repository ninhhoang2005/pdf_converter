=====================================

To translate the application into your own language, follow these simple steps:

2.  Copy the file 'en.json' and rename it to your language code (e.g., 'vi.json' for Vietnamese, 'fr.json' for French).
3.  Open the new file with any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
4.  You will see lines like this:
    "Select PDF": "Select PDF",

    "Select PDF": "Chọn tệp PDF",

5.  Save the file.
6.  Open PDF Converter.
